Stress is a natural part of life, especially during exams or high-pressure situations. However, it can be managed effectively through healthy habits and self-care strategies.

1. Practice deep breathing exercises to calm your nervous system.
2. Maintain a consistent sleep schedule to improve your cognitive performance.
3. Engage in regular physical activity like walking, yoga, or cycling.
4. Eat balanced meals and avoid excessive caffeine or sugar.
5. Use time management tools like planners or digital calendars to reduce overwhelm.
6. Talk to a friend, teacher, or mental health professional when needed.

These habits can help reduce stress levels and improve overall mental health.
